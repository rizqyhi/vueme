# âœ¨vueme

My seasoned boilerplate for [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) vue app. Based on [vue-pwa-boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa) with included webpack, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction.

## Documentation

- This template builds on top of the main webpack template, so please refer to the [webpack template docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack).

## Usage

You need [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to use this boilerplate.

```bash
$ vue init rizqyhi/vueme my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
```

## What's Included

* [All in this list](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa#whats-included), and:
* SASS pre-processor (`node-sass` and `sass-loader`)
* [`sass-resources-loader`](https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader), no need to import variables or mixins in every component anymore
